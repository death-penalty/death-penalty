## Hi there ! ðŸ«€
I go by Medic, Mr. Ludwig or Edd. My pronouns are he/it/she, most info will be seen on my strawpage. Open and not afraid to show it, a lesbian male and a gay woman, bearbutch. Overall, call me a lesboy if you'd like. I'm genderfluid and abrosexual.
I am **not** a rp pony / account, I'll be seen 'IC' sometimes but that does not mean I am looking for RP. Please don't come up to me for such! :-(
Unfortunately deathly afraid of interaction with strangers, approach with caution (slash silly..). Overall, I'm fine with C+H but keep this in mind.

TF2 and Overwatch enjoyer.
My beloved boyfriend made my Strawpage, with the text and gallery being done by me.
I hide and unfriend freely.
PLEASE leave me gimmicks or whispers! I love responding to them and I will try to add what I can onto the site! :-)
